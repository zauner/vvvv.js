The miserables.json file contains the weighted network of coappearances of
characters in Victor Hugo's novel /Les Miserables/. Nodes represent characters
as indicated by the labels, and edges connect any pair of characters that
appear in the same chapter of the book. The values on the edges are the number
of such coappearances. The data on coappearances were taken from D. E. Knuth,
"The Stanford GraphBase: A Platform for Combinatorial Computing",
Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA (1993).

The group labels were transcribed from "Finding and evaluating community
structure in networks" by M. E. J. Newman and M. Girvan.
